# Snake Game - JavaScript

This repository contains a classic snake game implemented using vanilla JavaScript. The game allows players to control a snake on the screen, eat food to grow longer, and avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.

## Features

- **Snake Movement**: The snake moves continuously on the game board based on the player's input.

- **Food Generation**: Food items are randomly generated on the game board for the snake to eat and grow.

- **Score Tracking**: The game keeps track of the player's score, increasing it each time the snake eats food.

- **Game Over**: The game ends when the snake collides with the walls or its own body, displaying the final score and allowing the player to restart the game.
